    "tag": "Re-inventing the classic, boring, clear gin, the hibiscus infused with this gin lends it a vivid red/pink color with tart berry and citrus flavors. Initially met with a lot of skepticism, this spirit quickly endears itself to the drinker after the first sip or two. Due to the color, this spirit makes a brilliantly colorful substitute for normal gin in almost any gin cocktail. For extra fun, try making a gin and tonic upside down (add the gin to the glass last) and watch as it works its way down through the ice."

Made with a much higher percentage of molasses (proudly mashed, fermented, and distilled in Winter Park, CO) than most rums, a lot of that flavor carries through the still, imbuing our rum with a much bolder, more full-bodied flavor than most. To top it off, it is briefly rested in used barrels to let it mellow and the depth of its flavors truly develop. Who cares if it wasn’t made in the Caribbean, it is still one of the best rums you’ve tasted!"

However, unlike most bourbons, our signature bourbon whiskey recipe (proudly mashed, fermented, and distilled in Winter Park, CO), is aged with three different types of wood for an incredible complexity and delightful marriage of flavors. Additionally, the fresh grains that we source from a local Colorado farm, gives the spirit an incredibly deep grain flavor that makes this whiskey truly unique."
